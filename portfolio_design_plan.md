# Interactive Portfolio Website Design Plan (Revised)

## 1. Overall Goal
To create a modern, interactive, and responsive single-page application (SPA) that effectively showcases Manish Chaudhari's professional profile, skills, experience, and projects, drawing content from his updated resume. The design will be heavily inspired by the reference site: https://varadbhogayata.github.io/.

## 2. Target Audience
Potential employers, recruiters, and professional contacts.

## 3. Key Sections & Layout (Inspired by Reference)

*   **Overall Layout:**
    *   A fixed vertical navigation sidebar on the left.
    *   A main content area on the right that scrolls through different sections.
    *   Each section in the main content area will have a distinct background color or style, similar to the reference.

*   **Sidebar Navigation:**
    *   Content: User's initials or a small avatar at the top. Navigation links with icons and text (e.g., About, Experience, Projects, Skills, Education, Contact, Resume).
    *   Interactivity: Active link highlighting based on the currently viewed section. Smooth scrolling to sections on click.

*   **Hero/Landing Section (Main Content Area - First Section):**
    *   Content: Large greeting (e.g., "Hi, I'm Manish Chaudhari."), Title (Senior AI Business Analyst), a compelling tagline, links to LinkedIn/GitHub (if available), and Call to Action buttons (e.g., "View My Work" or "Get In Touch").
    *   Styling: Prominent typography, clean background.

*   **About Me Section:**
    *   Content: Expanded Professional Summary. Key skills/technologies can be listed here as well (Languages, Databases, Libraries, Frameworks, Tools & Technologies, similar to reference).
    *   Styling: Clear heading, readable paragraphs.

*   **Experience Section:**
    *   Content: Detailed job roles, company names, dates, locations, and key responsibilities/achievements for each position.
    *   Styling: Card-based layout for each experience item, potentially with company logos if provided by the user. Clear separation between roles.

*   **Projects Section:**
    *   Content: Showcase 2-3 key projects with descriptions, technologies used, user's role, and outcomes. Links to live demos or repositories if available.
    *   Styling: Card-based layout, similar to experience or a distinct project card style. Visuals (screenshots/diagrams) would be beneficial if provided.

*   **Skills Section:**
    *   Content: Categorized skills (Business & System Analysis, Technical & AI Prowess, etc.).
    *   Styling: Visually distinct presentation, perhaps using badges, progress bars (if appropriate and not cluttered), or grouped lists under clear subheadings.

*   **Education Section:**
    *   Content: Degrees, institutions, graduation dates (or expected).
    *   Styling: Clean, chronological listing, possibly with institution logos if provided.

*   **Certifications Section:** (May be integrated into Education or Skills, or be a standalone section if extensive)
    *   Content: List of certifications with issuing bodies.
    *   Styling: Grid or list layout. User may provide certification images/logos.

*   **Contact Section:**
    *   Content: Email address, phone number, LinkedIn profile link, GitHub profile link.
    *   Styling: Clear contact information with icons.

## 4. Design & Styling (Inspired by Reference)
*   **Theme:** Professional, modern, clean, with distinct colored sections. The reference uses a teal/greenish hue for section headers and a light grid background for content areas.
*   **Typography:** Readable and modern sans-serif fonts.
*   **Layout:** Responsive design. Fixed left sidebar, scrollable right content area.
*   **Visuals:** Use icons extensively in the sidebar and for contact information. Company/institution/certification logos if provided.

## 5. Interactivity & Animations
*   **General:** Smooth scrolling, active navigation highlighting. Subtle hover effects on interactive elements.
*   **Specifics:** On-scroll reveal animations for content can be considered if not distracting.

## 6. Technology Stack
*   **Frontend:** React (using the `create_react_app` template: Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Lucide icons).
*   **Deployment:** Static site hosting.

## 7. Content Source
*   `revised_resume.txt` and `Manish_Chaudhari_Resume_Updated.docx`.

## 8. Next Steps (Implementation Outline - Revised)
1.  **Restructure `App.tsx`**: Create a layout with a fixed sidebar and a main scrollable content area.
2.  **Develop `Sidebar.tsx` component**: Implement navigation links with icons and text. Plan for active state highlighting.
3.  **Create/Update Section Components**: Develop React components for each section (Hero, About, Skills, Experience, etc.) adapting their structure and styling to match the reference design.
4.  **Populate Components**: Fill components with content from the resume, formatted appropriately.
5.  **Implement Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS to match the reference site's color scheme, typography, and layout for each section and the sidebar.
6.  **Add Interactivity**: Implement smooth scrolling, active navigation highlighting, and other subtle interactive elements.
7.  **Testing**: Thoroughly test for responsiveness, interactivity, and browser compatibility.
8.  **Deployment**: Prepare for deployment.
